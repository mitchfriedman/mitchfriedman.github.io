                <h3>Hi, I'm Mitch.</h3>
                <p>I'm a student at the University of Guelph studying Computer Science.  If you've gotten this far into my site I'm sure you can tell that I like to code.  I am interested in all sorts of topics in software development, but systems development is in the lead so far.</p>
